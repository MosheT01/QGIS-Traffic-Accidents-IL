Here’s a summary of the steps we took to generate the file with traffic count data and its corresponding X, Y coordinates:

### Steps to Generate the Merged Traffic Count with Coordinates File

1. **Extract and Inspect Traffic Count Data**:
   - We started by loading the traffic count data from the CSV file (`H20211092TabMef.csv`). This file contained columns such as road number (`kvish`), segment (`keta`), and traffic counts (`kamut_kle_rehev`).

2. **Extract Road Segment Data with Coordinates**:
   - We then loaded the road segment data from the Excel file (`H20211092RoadsNonUrban.xlsx`). This file included columns like the road number (`כביש`), segment number (`קטע`), and the corresponding geographic coordinates (`X`, `Y`).

3. **Renaming Columns for Consistency**:
   - To facilitate the merge, we renamed the relevant columns in the road segment data to match those in the traffic count data (`kvish` for road number, `keta` for segment number).

4. **Merging the Data**:
   - We merged the traffic count data with the road segment data based on the road number (`kvish`) and segment number (`keta`). This allowed us to append the X, Y coordinates to each traffic count entry.

5. **Exporting the Merged Data**:
   - Finally, we exported the merged data to a new CSV file (`merged_traffic_count_with_coordinates.csv`), which now contains traffic counts along with their specific geographic coordinates.

### Resulting File
- The final file (`merged_traffic_count_with_coordinates.csv`) contains traffic count data with each entry linked to specific X, Y coordinates, making it suitable for spatial analysis in GIS tools like QGIS.

This file can now be used to map and analyze the relationship between traffic counts and road segments, including any further spatial analysis related to traffic accidents or other factors.



CODE

# First, let's rename the relevant columns in the roads_non_urban_data for consistency
roads_non_urban_data.rename(columns={'כביש': 'kvish', 'קטע': 'keta', 'x': 'X', 'y': 'Y'}, inplace=True)

# Now, let's merge the traffic count data with the road segment data based on 'kvish' and 'keta'
merged_data = pd.merge(traffic_count_data, roads_non_urban_data[['kvish', 'keta', 'X', 'Y']], on=['kvish', 'keta'], how='left')

# Display the first few rows of the merged data to verify the merge
merged_data.head()
