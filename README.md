# QGIS-Traffic-Accidents-IL

This project aims to analyze the relationship between traffic volumes and accident severity in Israel from 2015 to 2021. It involves unifying scattered traffic and accident data into one standardized dataset, using Python for data cleaning and QGIS for data visualization.

## Project Overview

- **Data Sources**: Traffic and accident data from various sources between 2015-2021.
- **Goal**: To identify patterns and correlations between traffic volumes and accident severity.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Merging and standardizing data from multiple years using Python.
- **Visualization**: Creating insightful maps and graphs using QGIS.
- **Analysis**: Examining the relationship between traffic data and accident severity.
